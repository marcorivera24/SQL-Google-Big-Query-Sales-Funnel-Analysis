End-to-End SQL Sales Funnel &amp; Revenue Analysis (BigQuery)  Built a complete e-commerce analytics project using SQL in Google BigQuery to analyze user behavior, funnel performance, marketing channel effectiveness, and revenue metrics.  The project covers sales funnel stage tracking, conversion rate calculations, traffic source analysis.


E-Commerce Sales Funnel & Revenue Analysis (SQL | BigQuery)
🚀 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end SQL analytics case study built using Google BigQuery and real-world e-commerce event data.

The goal is to analyze user behavior across the sales funnel, identify drop-offs, evaluate marketing channel performance, and generate revenue insights using practical SQL queries.
